## Bank + Senator

A validator on LikeCoin chain is both a bank and a senator in LikeCoin DAO.

Operates a set of servers 24x7 to validate all transactions of Likers, including token transfers, content publishing, voting and etc.

### Validating Transaction (Bank)

In order to reach consensus in a community, some trusted parties have to record all transactions. In traditional world, this is performed by banks which charges various fees. In Liker Land, peer-to-peer transactions in general takes 5 seconds at extremely low cost.

### Raising a proposal and Vote (Senator)

Endorsement by Likers is reflected by delegation. When a Liker delegates her LikeCoin to a validator, she is trusting its technical ability, knowledge and integrity, and is letting it represent her.
