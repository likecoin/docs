# Where comes the LikeCoin rewards?

![](../../.gitbook/assets/likecoin\_postlist\_1216.png)

_This article reflects the numbers during on January 31, 2022. All parameters can be changed in the future through the governance mechanism, such as_ [_Proposal 7_](https://likecoin.bigdipper.live/proposals/7)_._

Delegate LikeCoin and earn rewards, this article explains where the LikeCoin rewards come from. Delegation generates rewards as each delegator helps to validate transactions.\
\
Validator's rewards for recording all transactions is from inflation, currently set up as 7-20% of the 1.8 billion LikeCoin so far, which is issuing 76.5 million-265 million LikeCoin per year.

The inflation amount will be distributed when a block is created in LikeCoin chain, approximately in every 5-6 seconds

2% of the newly minted LikeCoin from inflation will be treated as "Tax" and reserved for the Community Pool. In other words, 98% of LikeCoin from inflation is for validators and stakeholders. Usage of the Community Pool will be determined accordingly to the community's autonomous mechanisms.

If a block is created on every 6 seconds, the number of new blocks created per year are 365\*24\*60\*10 = 5,256,000, therefore the LikeCoin shared to each validators and stakeholders from each block are:

\= 10,000,000 LikeCoin x 98% / 5,256,000

\= 47.7 LikeCoin

That means 47.7 LikeCoin is minted every 6 seconds for validators and stakeholders to distribute according to their delegation ratio. If the commission rate of a validator is 10%, the LikeCoin given to stakeholders every 6 seconds will be 47.7 x (100%-10%) = 42.93 LIKE.

The above calculation based on the assumption of a new block is created every 6 second, but in fact there are deviations in real life. Adding to the 98% from inflation, 98% transaction fee from each transaction will also be distributed to validators and stakeholders according to their delegation ratio.
