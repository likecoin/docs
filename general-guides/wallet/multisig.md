# Multisig

A multi-signature wallet ("multisig") is a cryptocurrency wallet that requires two or more private keys for generating, signing and sending transactions on Cosmos chains.

## Pluto

[Pluto](https://likecoin-cosmos-pluto.netlify.app/) is a community-developed GUI widget for creating and signing LikeCoin multisig wallets. You are welcome to contribute [source code](https://github.com/likecoin/likecoin-cosmos-pluto) and build together!
