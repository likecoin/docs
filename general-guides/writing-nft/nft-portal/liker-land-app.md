### Change the NFT cover

Click ":pencil2:" on the picture and then click ":game\_die:" to generate a unique AI cover image. Click ":open\_file\_folder:" to upload or modify an existing picture. If you don't need to change it / the article has no picture, the default OG picture of the article will be displayed / no picture will be displayed.

Click "Next" to continue.

## Step 3/4: Add Creator message and Reserve Writing NFT

Creator message is a special paragraph of each article by the author. Unlike the Transfer message, all the Writing NFTs under the same collection shares the same creator message, and is stored on the NFT class data on chain.

Click "Add message to your collectors‚Äù to input the message.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Portal 5-1.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Enter Writing NFT Creator message</p></figcaption></figure>

A window pops up, enters the content and clicks "Confirm". Note that the message cannot exceed 256 characters.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Portal 5-2.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Enters the content and clicks "Confirm"</p></figcaption></figure>

Check whether the content is correct or not. If they need to be modified, you can press "Edit" to change it.

In addition, if you want to reserve some Writing NFT for yourself or change the initial price, click "More settings".

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Portal 5-3.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Edit Writing NFT Creator message and click "More settings"</p></figcaption></figure>

In the "Number of NFTs to premint" field, you can enter the quantity of NFTs to be pre-minted, ranging from 0 to 255.

In the "Numbers of NFTs reserved for giveaways" field, you can reserve a quantity of NFTs (ranging from 0 to 255) for giveaways.

Clicking "Reserve All" will reserve all the pre-minted NFTs and those reserved for giveaways at once.

In the Sales Settings, you can set the initial price for the Writing NFTs, which can be All Free, 8, 128, 1024, or 4096 LIKE. "All Free" means allowing collecters to freely mint NFTs on their own, they just have to pay [transaction fee](../../wallet/transaction-fee.md) . If not configured, the default initial price is set at 128 LIKE.

Once done, click "Next".

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Portal 5-4.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Enter the number of Writing NFT to premint and reserve for giveaways, then set the initial price</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Creators can also set their Writing NFT as "not for sale" by filling in the "Number of NFTs to premint" equal to the "Number of NFTs reserved for giveaways." This means that the creator reserves all NFTs for gifting purposes, achieving the effect of setting the NFT as "not for sale," as the issued NFTs are all reserved by the creator and will not circulate in the market. Writing NFTs reserved by the author can be given away for free or sold on the [NFT Marketplace](../collect-writing-nft/nft-marketplace.md).

The difference between "Reserved NFT" and "Free Mint" lies in the fact that all minted NFTs are retained and [distributed by the authors](../transfer-writing-nft.md) themselves in the former, whereas in the latter, collectors mint them on their own and the system automatically sends them out.

## Step 4/4: Sign

Liker Land app windows will pop up, please click "Approve" to sign and register ISCN ID, Arweave ID, Class ID and mint NFT.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Portal 6-1.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Sign to Register ISCN ID, Arweave ID, Class ID &#x26; Mint Writing NFT</p></figcaption></figure>

Seeing Completed! and the 3D cover image means that the NFT has been minted. If the [LikeCoin button](../../../user-guide/creator/) has not been installed on the website, you can directly paste the code of Embed NFT widget into your site, and the [NFT Widget](../collect-writing-nft/nft-widget.md) can be displayed on any web page.

Click "View Your NFT" to view your Writing NFT.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Portal 6-3-en.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Check out the published Writing NFT</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note if the URL is directly registered with ISCN in this way when publishing a Writing NFT, the system will automatically grab the article title and content as metadata.

**If you want your work to have detailed metadata, please** [**register an ISCN**](../../decentralized-publishing/app.like.co.md) **and** [**publish Writing NFT with the ISCN ID**](by-iscn-id.md)**.**
