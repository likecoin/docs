## likecli

In the old SheungWan software, commands are split into two executables: `liked` for server and `likecli` for client.

However, since the FoTan upgrade, two commands are now combined, so `likecli` is deprecated.

If you have keys managed by `likecli`, you can migrate those keys by `liked keys migrate`.

For the RESTful API, it is also built into `liked`, you may enable the APIs from `.liked/config/app.toml` and open the corresponding ports.
