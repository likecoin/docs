By the time this is published, Genesis block of LikeCoin chain has been produced. If that is not your language, try understand it this way: Republic of Liker Land was established on the cyberspace.

This article introduces the elements and the mechanism of Liker Land, using as little technical jargon as possible. Developers are encouraged to check out our technical documentations or, better yet, our source codes which are open on [github](https://github.com/likecoin).

## Basic concepts <a id="448e"></a>

### Republic of Liker Land <a id="84f4"></a>

Or _Liker Land_ for short, is a decentralized community in cyberspace among content creators and consumers, who collectively own and govern the community.

In blockchain terminology, _Liker Land_ is a decentralized autonomous organization, or **DAO**.

### Liker <a id="5799"></a>

A citizen in _Republic of Liker Land_. Each _Liker_ has a unique _Liker ID_ to identify herself. While many _Likers_ are writers, photographers, illustrators, editors and curators, _Liker Land_ totally welcomes silent content consumers and offers services for them to involve and contribute without creating contents.

### Civic Liker <a id="75ea"></a>

A _Liker_ who joins the USD5 monthly subscription service. _Civic Liker_ is essentially __a tax payer in _Liker Land_ and enjoys various benefits while at the same time supports creators.

### Liker Land app <a id="2696"></a>

Reader, passport and wallet all integrated in one single app. [_Liker Land_](https://liker.land/) mobile app is essentially government of the Republic on your palm.

Some tech lovers prefer lower level tools such as command line interface and hardware wallet. It requires significant technical know-how and is beyond the scope of this article.

### LikeCoin button <a id="82e1"></a>

The trademarked hands-clapping button attached to stories, images, illustrations and other creative contents, on which a _Liker_ claps to show her appreciation.

### LikeCoin token <a id="c246"></a>

Usually called _LikeCoin_ for short, it is the de facto token in _Liker Land._ _LikeCoin_ has 3 major uses:

* **Storing and exchanging value**. Used to reward creators, _validators_, and for payments in general.
* **Representing the contribution and thus voting power of a** _**Liker**_. The more contribution a _Liker_ makes, the more _LikeCoin_ she receives and the more influential power she has in _Liker Land_.
* **Bridging with other communities and the traditional world**. _LikeCoin_ can be exchanged into and from Bitcoin, Ethereum, TWD, HKD and other traditional and crypto currencies. The ticker of _LikeCoin_ is LIKE. Note however that a token trading with the ticker LIKE is not necessarily _LikeCoin_. Special attention has to be paid to avoid scamming.

### LikeCoin chain <a id="aa59"></a>

A distributed ledger of the Republic, the open government of _Liker Land_. A sovereign, application specific blockchain designed for content creation and information property management, offering high-speed, low cost and most importantly, independence. Data on _LikeCoin chain_ is open and can be visualized on [**Big Dipper**](https://likecoin.bigdipper.live/).

The very first beta of _LikeCoin chain_, code-named **KaiTak**, was released on Apr 2019 and was upgraded to **Taipei** on Sept 2019 as the new beta testnet. First public release of _LikeCoin chain_, **SheungWan**, was just launched on Nov 15, signaling the establishment of Republic of Liker Land.

_LikeCoin chain_ **FoTan**, which incorporates advanced features such as International Standard Content Number \(_“ISCN”_\), is planned in 2020.

### Validator <a id="9d28"></a>

Operates a set of servers 24x7 to validate all transactions of _Likers_, including token transfers, content publishing, voting and etc. A _validator_ on _LikeCoin chain_ is both a bank and a senator in _Liker Land_.

To start with, _validators_ of _LikeCoin chain_ include [**National Taipei University of Technology**](https://www.ntut.edu.tw/), [**Forbole**](https://www.forbole.com/), **The** [**Standnews**](https://thestandnews.com/), [**Culture and Media Education Foundation**](https://www.cmef.org.hk/eng), [**Hong Kong Creative Open Technology Association**](https://cota.hk/), [**Matters Lab**](https://matters.news/), **GLOs**, [**Enyk Security**](https://enyk.io/), [**UDomain**](https://www.udomain.com/) and [**OurSky**](https://oursky.com/).

## Mechanism <a id="d993"></a>

### Token issuance <a id="397c"></a>

When _LikeCoin_ was first introduced in 2017, it was an “ERC-20 token” issued on Ethereum blockchain. To distinguish from the new standard used in Liker Land, the legacy token will be stated explicitly as LikeCoin ERC-20 while the new token referred as _LikeCoin token_ or simply _LikeCoin_.

Following the original _LikeCoin_ whitepaper, there will be up to 2bil _LikeCoin_ in the long run. The _LikeCoin_ is assigned to **Token Sale Pool** \(360,538,485\), **Ecosystem Development Pool** \(439,461,515\), **Team Pool** \(200mil\), and **Creators Pool** \(1bil\) for their corresponding usages. 1bil _LikeCoin_ was minted in Genesis for migration from **Token Sale Pool**, **Ecosystem Development Pool**, **Team Pool**, while **Creators Pool** will be processed in future upgrade.

### **Migration** <a id="4ee6"></a>

As _Liker Land_ starts to operate, tentatively set on Dec 2 2019, _LikeCoin_ will replace LikeCoin ERC-20 as the official token in _Liker Land_, which means content creators will be rewarded in _LikeCoin_. The 1bil _LikeCoin_ at Genesis was stored in a migration pool and the only way to unlock a certain amount of _LikeCoin_ is to migrate the same amount of LikeCoin ERC-20, on a 1:1 basis. A migration page will be provided for _Likers_. LikeCoin ERC-20, however, can still be kept and traded on [Liquid](https://www.liquid.com/) for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

When LikeCoin ERC-20 is migrated to _LikeCoin_, the former will be burnt on Ethereum, so that the total number of _LikeCoin plus_ LikeCoin ERC-20 in circulation remains unchanged.

New _LikeCoin_ will be minted at an inflation rate determined by the validators collectively. The inflation rate was set at 1% at the Genesis of _Liker Land_. The newly minted _LikeCoin_ is for rewarding validation of transactions \(see **Validating Transaction** below\).

### Rewarding creativity. Supporting the commons. <a id="61ef"></a>

With _Liker Land_ being a community of content creators and lovers, appreciation of and rewarding for creativity is a core value.

In contrast to Like Button of Facebook and other social media, tapping a _LikeCoin button — clapping —_ provides the corresponding creators with tangible rewards. A content can be clapped by a _Liker_ 1–5 times to reflect the degree of appreciation. Each clap represents a vote for the content, helping the creator receive part of the **Creators Pool** allocated for that day.

A _Civic Liker_ enjoys higher weighting for her claps, which other than the **Creators Pool** __also distributes all of her own monthly payment to creators on average. _LikeCoin button_ is like an assistant to _Likers,_ helping them micro reward creativity automatically with claps as a signal of appreciation.

### Validating Transaction <a id="9e68"></a>

In order to reach consensus in a community, some trusted parties have to record all transactions. In traditional world, this is performed by banks which charges various fees. In _Liker Land_, peer-to-peer transactions in general takes 5 seconds at extremely low cost. Such a system is realized collectively by _validators_, endorsed by _Likers_.

Endorsement by _Likers_ is reflected by _delegation._ When a _Liker_ delegates her _LikeCoin_ to a _validator_, she is trusting its technical ability, knowledge and integrity, and is letting it represent her. Similar to saving in banks, delegated _LikeCoin_ is still owned by the _Liker_, but it takes 21 days to undelegate and get back the _LikeCoin_ to one’s own wallet.

The voting power of a particular _validator_ equals the total amount of _LikeCoin_ delegated to it, since it reflects the level of endorsement it receives from the community. Approximately every 5 seconds, a block is created in _LikeCoin chain_ to record all transactions during the period. Every _validator_ has to agree and sign the block to confirm. If everyone or more than two third of voting power agrees, the block and thus all transactions within it will be confirmed. In this case, all signing _validators_ will be rewarded some newly minted _LikeCoin_ according to their voting power. The newly minted _LikeCoin_ comes from inflation, which is set at 1% at genesis. The rewards are split 50:50 between the _validator_ and the _Likers_ who delegated their _LikeCoin_.

If, however, a _validator_ does not perform its duty or act maliciously, there will be penalty:

* **Unavailability**. Offline for more than 95% of times in the previous 10,000 blocks, i.e. the _validator_ participated for fewer than 500 blocks in the previously 10,000 blocks. In this case 0.01% of the delegated _LikeCoin_ will be slashed and the _validator_ be “jailed”, until the _validator_ unjail itself after at least 10 minutes.
* **Double signing**. Validates 2 conflicting blocks at the same time, which is fatal because it allows an amount to be spent twice. In this case, the _validator_ will be permanently removed, and 5% of the delegations will be slashed.

In both cases, delegated _LikeCoin_ from _Likers_ will be slashed at the same ratio. It is important for _Likers_ to delegate only to _validators_ they can trust.

In blockchain jargon, the above mechanism of decentralized consensus is called Byzantine Fault Tolerance \(**BFT**\), achieved through Delegated Proof of Stake \(**DPoS**\).

## **Governance** <a id="ca09"></a>

As stated in the very beginning, _Liker Land_ is collectively owned and governed by the community. A [liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy) system is designed and deployed upon Genesis to enable the self governance of Liker Land by all _Likers_ though _validators_.

### Delegation <a id="c538"></a>

When a _Liker_ delegates _LikeCoin_ to a _validator_, not only does the _Liker_ helps validating transactions in the community and earns rewards, she also endorses the _validator_ to represent her to raise proposals and vote for or against the proposals. This is called [liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy). In this aspect, delegation is like voting in a representative democracy society, except even better, a _Liker_ may also decide how much _LikeCoin_ to delegate to reflect the level of endorsement, and may delegate to one or more _validators_.

### Raising a proposal <a id="81f6"></a>

Every proposal is a change to the current system. After all, it is not very meaningful to pass a proposal that changes nothing. All _validators_ may raise proposals.

Some aspects of proposals include:

* **On technical issues**. Such as software updates, new features and other technical changes.
* **On economics**. Such as increasing or decreasing the inflation rate and minting _LikeCoin_ in **Creator Pool** to reward creators.
* **On media and contents**. Such as new ways to reward creativity, measures to combat disinformation, malinformation and infringement of intellectual property right.

In order for a proposal to enter the voting period, 1mil _LikeCoin_ has to be deposited within 2 weeks. Instead of having the _validator_ who raised the proposal to deposit all 1mil _LikeCoin_, the deposit may come from other _validators_ and _Likers._

In case the proposal receive less than 1mil _LikeCoin_ deposit, the proposal will be abandoned and the deposit goes to the **Community Pool**, exact use of which determined by other proposals.

### Voting <a id="a839"></a>

All _validators_ may then vote during a 2-week voting period. There are four options to every proposal: **Yes**, **No**, **Abstain** and **Veto**. Veto is to express a “No” so strong that the _validator_ believes the proposal should not be proposed in the first place, and should have its deposit expropriated to **Community Pool**.

During the voting period, if a _Liker_ does not agree with the option picked by the _validator_ representing her, she may transfer her delegated _LikeCoin_ to another _validator_. This is another area liquid democracy improves over tradition representative democracy.

### Result <a id="a4c5"></a>

The proposal would be implemented if it is passed. It happens when:

* **Quorum**. _Validators_ holding 40% or more delegated LikeCoin particated in the voting.
* **Simple majority**. With the exception of Abstain, more than 50% of the votes \(voting power is proportional to delegated _LikeCoin_\) go to Yes.
* **No veto**. Less than one-third of the votes go to Veto.

In case quorum is not reached or the proposal is vetoed, the 1 mil _LikeCoin_ deposit goes to the **Community Pool**. In other cases, the deposit will be returned to the _Likers._

## Future Development <a id="b575"></a>

With the Genesis of _Liker Land_, _LikeCoin_ ecosystem __is entering a whole new paradigm. Services and governance of _Liker Land_ is designed in a way closely resembling a modern society, with some enhancements. With the governance by liquid democracy in place, every aspect of _Liker Land_ can be improved through proposals of change, including, most fundamentally, the constitution.

As a result, the design and governance of the Republic will no longer be solely in the hands of core development team, who will nonetheless continue to dedicate their time and effort to _LikeCoin._ From now on, _Liker Land_ will be collectively owned and governed by her stakeholders, all _Likers_.

Despite all the exciting development, it is just the Genesis.
