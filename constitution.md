By the time this is published, Genesis block of LikeCoin chain has been produced. If that is not your language, try understand it this way: Republic of Liker Land was established on the cyberspace.

This article introduces the elements and the mechanism of Liker Land, using as little technical jargon as possible. Developers are encouraged to check out our technical documentations or, better yet, our source codes which are open on [github](https://github.com/likecoin).

## 基本概念 <a id="448e"></a>

### 讚賞公民共和國 <a id="84f4"></a>

或簡稱 _Liker Land_ ，是一個由作者及內容消費者組成，並共同管治的分散式網絡社群。

以區塊鏈的術語來說，讚賞公民共和國是一個分散式自治機構 (**DAO**, decentralized autonomous organization)

### Liker <a id="5799"></a>

讚賞公民共和國的市民。每位 _Liker_ 擁有一獨特的 _Liker ID_ 以資識別。雖然很多 _Likers_ 是作者、攝影師、繪師、編輯、及內容管理者，_Liker Land_ 也完全歡迎不生產內容的內容消費者的參與和投入，並為他們提供服務。

### 讚賞公民 <a id="75ea"></a>

一個每月付出 5 美元月費的  _Liker_，是讚賞公民共和國的 _納稅人_，在支持創作的同時亦能享有一些獨特的好處。

### Liker Land app <a id="2696"></a>

一個整合了閱讀器、護照及錢包的 app。[_Liker Land_](https://liker.land/) 移動應用程式有如你掌上的共和國政府。

有些技術愛好者或更喜歡使用如命令字元介面及硬體錢包等底層工具。這需要相當的技術知識，已超出本文的關注範疇。

### 讚賞鍵 <a id="82e1"></a>

一個已註冊商標的拍手鍵，附帶在故事、圖像、畫作及其他創作內容中，讓 _Liker_ 按讚表達讚賞，同時為作者帶來收入。
[Matters](https://matters.news) 上所有文章已預設提供讚賞鍵，特約媒體作者也可把 _Liker ID_ 提供予[香港獨立媒體網](https://inmediahk.net)、[立場新聞](https://thestandnews.com)、[眾新聞](https://hkcnews.com) 等合作媒體；自媒體作者於自架 WordPress 網站安裝 [LikeCoin 插件](https://zh-hk.wordpress.org/plugins/likecoin/)，每篇文章下方便自動加上 讚賞鍵，[Medium](https://medium.com) 作者可在文章中自行貼上讚賞鍵鏈結。


### LikeCoin 通證 <a id="c246"></a>
一般會簡稱為 _LikeCoin_，讚賞公民共和國的貨幣，主要用途有三：
* **儲存及交換價值：** 用作奬賞創作者、 _驗證人_ 等，及一般付款用途。
* **代表一位 _Liker_ 的貢獻及投票權重：** 貢獻愈大，會獲得愈多 _LikeCoin_，從而在共和國中有更大的影響力。
* **作為跟其他社群及傳統世界的橋樑：**  _LikeCoin_ 可兌換成比特幣、以太幣、台幣、港幣及其他傳統或加密貨幣。 _LikeCoin_ 的代號是 _LIKE_，但留意 _LIKE_ 代號在交易過程中並非必須。另，使用者必須特別提防假冒詐騙。

### LikeCoin chain <a id="aa59"></a>

讚賞公民共和國政府去中心化的數據記錄，專為內容創作和資料產權而設計，提供高效、便宜，及尤其重要的獨立性。LikeCoin chain 上的開放數據可在 [**Big Dipper**](https://likecoin.bigdipper.live) 上瀏覽。
2019年四月開發出 _LikeCoin chain_ 初代測試版本代號為 **KaiTak**（啟德），並於九月份升級為新的測試網絡 **Taipei**（台北）。直至 11月15日 被命名為 **SheungWan**（上環）的 _LikeCoin chain_ 第一次公開發怖，同時亦標誌著 _讚賞公民共和國_ 的誕生。
LikeCoin chain **FoTan** 版本將提供 International Standard Content Number \(_"ISCN"_\) 高階功能，預計 2020 年推出。


### 驗證人 <a id="9d28"></a>
負責 7x24 營運伺服器群以核實所有 _Likers_ 的資料記錄，包括代幣轉賬、內容發佈、投票動作等。 _LikeCoin chain_ 上的 _驗證人_ 同時擔當 _讚賞公民共和國_ 銀行及立法委員的角色。

讚賞公民共和國立國後，第一批共 7 組承擔重任的驗證人是：
* [**國立臺北科技大學**](https://www.ntut.edu.tw/)

![first batch of validators of LikeCoin chain](https://miro.medium.com/max/2558/1*FKd6sXXYNxDp6hgFjju-0A.png)

## 機制 <a id="d993"></a>

### 通證發行 <a id="397c"></a>

_LikeCoin_ 在 2017 年首次面世時在以太坊區塊鏈以 「ERC-20 通證」 形式發行。升級至讚賞公民共和國的新標準以後，舊版本代幣被稱為 _LikeCoin ERC-20_，升級了的代幣則被稱為 _LikeCoin 通證_ ，或簡稱 _LikeCoin_ 。

Following the original _LikeCoin_ whitepaper, there will be up to 2bil _LikeCoin_ in the long run. The _LikeCoin_ is assigned to **Token Sale Pool** \(360,538,485\), **Ecosystem Development Pool** \(439,461,515\), **Team Pool** \(200mil\), and **Creators Pool** \(1bil\) for their corresponding usages. 1bil _LikeCoin_ was minted in Genesis for migration from **Token Sale Pool**, **Ecosystem Development Pool**, **Team Pool**, while **Creators Pool** will be processed in future upgrade.

### **轉移** <a id="4ee6"></a>

As _Liker Land_ starts to operate, tentatively set on Dec 2 2019, _LikeCoin_ will replace LikeCoin ERC-20 as the official token in _Liker Land_, which means content creators will be rewarded in _LikeCoin_. The 1bil _LikeCoin_ at Genesis was stored in a migration pool and the only way to unlock a certain amount of _LikeCoin_ is to migrate the same amount of LikeCoin ERC-20, on a 1:1 basis. A migration page will be provided for _Likers_. LikeCoin ERC-20, however, can still be kept and traded on [Liquid](https://www.liquid.com/) for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

When LikeCoin ERC-20 is migrated to _LikeCoin_, the former will be burnt on Ethereum, so that the total number of _LikeCoin plus_ LikeCoin ERC-20 in circulation remains unchanged.

New _LikeCoin_ will be minted at an inflation rate determined by the validators collectively. The inflation rate was set at 1% at the Genesis of _Liker Land_. The newly minted _LikeCoin_ is for rewarding validation of transactions \(see **Validating Transaction** below\).

### Rewarding creativity. Supporting the commons. <a id="61ef"></a>

With _Liker Land_ being a community of content creators and lovers, appreciation of and rewarding for creativity is a core value.

In contrast to Like Button of Facebook and other social media, tapping a _LikeCoin button — clapping —_ provides the corresponding creators with tangible rewards. A content can be clapped by a _Liker_ 1–5 times to reflect the degree of appreciation. Each clap represents a vote for the content, helping the creator receive part of the **Creators Pool** allocated for that day.

A _Civic Liker_ enjoys higher weighting for her claps, which other than the **Creators Pool** __also distributes all of her own monthly payment to creators on average. _LikeCoin button_ is like an assistant to _Likers,_ helping them micro reward creativity automatically with claps as a signal of appreciation.

### Validating Transaction <a id="9e68"></a>

In order to reach consensus in a community, some trusted parties have to record all transactions. In traditional world, this is performed by banks which charges various fees. In _Liker Land_, peer-to-peer transactions in general takes 5 seconds at extremely low cost. Such a system is realized collectively by _validators_, endorsed by _Likers_.

Endorsement by _Likers_ is reflected by _delegation._ When a _Liker_ delegates her _LikeCoin_ to a _validator_, she is trusting its technical ability, knowledge and integrity, and is letting it represent her. Similar to saving in banks, delegated _LikeCoin_ is still owned by the _Liker_, but it takes 21 days to undelegate and get back the _LikeCoin_ to one’s own wallet.

The voting power of a particular _validator_ equals the total amount of _LikeCoin_ delegated to it, since it reflects the level of endorsement it receives from the community. Approximately every 5 seconds, a block is created in _LikeCoin chain_ to record all transactions during the period. Every _validator_ has to agree and sign the block to confirm. If everyone or more than two third of voting power agrees, the block and thus all transactions within it will be confirmed. In this case, all signing _validators_ will be rewarded some newly minted _LikeCoin_ according to their voting power. The newly minted _LikeCoin_ comes from inflation, which is set at 1% at genesis. The rewards are split 50:50 between the _validator_ and the _Likers_ who delegated their _LikeCoin_.

If, however, a _validator_ does not perform its duty or act maliciously, there will be penalty:

* **Unavailability**. Offline for more than 95% of times in the previous 10,000 blocks, i.e. the _validator_ participated for fewer than 500 blocks in the previously 10,000 blocks. In this case 0.01% of the delegated _LikeCoin_ will be slashed and the _validator_ be “jailed”, until the _validator_ unjail itself after at least 10 minutes.
* **Double signing**. Validates 2 conflicting blocks at the same time, which is fatal because it allows an amount to be spent twice. In this case, the _validator_ will be permanently removed, and 5% of the delegations will be slashed.

In both cases, delegated _LikeCoin_ from _Likers_ will be slashed at the same ratio. It is important for _Likers_ to delegate only to _validators_ they can trust.

In blockchain jargon, the above mechanism of decentralized consensus is called Byzantine Fault Tolerance \(**BFT**\), achieved through Delegated Proof of Stake \(**DPoS**\).

## **Governance** <a id="ca09"></a>

As stated in the very beginning, _Liker Land_ is collectively owned and governed by the community. A [liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy) system is designed and deployed upon Genesis to enable the self governance of Liker Land by all _Likers_ though _validators_.

### Delegation <a id="c538"></a>

When a _Liker_ delegates _LikeCoin_ to a _validator_, not only does the _Liker_ helps validating transactions in the community and earns rewards, she also endorses the _validator_ to represent her to raise proposals and vote for or against the proposals. This is called [liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy). In this aspect, delegation is like voting in a representative democracy society, except even better, a _Liker_ may also decide how much _LikeCoin_ to delegate to reflect the level of endorsement, and may delegate to one or more _validators_.

### Raising a proposal <a id="81f6"></a>

Every proposal is a change to the current system. After all, it is not very meaningful to pass a proposal that changes nothing. All _validators_ may raise proposals.

Some aspects of proposals include:

* **On technical issues**. Such as software updates, new features and other technical changes.
* **On economics**. Such as increasing or decreasing the inflation rate and minting _LikeCoin_ in **Creator Pool** to reward creators.
* **On media and contents**. Such as new ways to reward creativity, measures to combat disinformation, malinformation and infringement of intellectual property right.

In order for a proposal to enter the voting period, 1mil _LikeCoin_ has to be deposited within 2 weeks. Instead of having the _validator_ who raised the proposal to deposit all 1mil _LikeCoin_, the deposit may come from other _validators_ and _Likers._

In case the proposal receive less than 1mil _LikeCoin_ deposit, the proposal will be abandoned and the deposit goes to the **Community Pool**, exact use of which determined by other proposals.

### Voting <a id="a839"></a>

All _validators_ may then vote during a 2-week voting period. There are four options to every proposal: **Yes**, **No**, **Abstain** and **Veto**. Veto is to express a “No” so strong that the _validator_ believes the proposal should not be proposed in the first place, and should have its deposit expropriated to **Community Pool**.

During the voting period, if a _Liker_ does not agree with the option picked by the _validator_ representing her, she may transfer her delegated _LikeCoin_ to another _validator_. This is another area liquid democracy improves over tradition representative democracy.

### Result <a id="a4c5"></a>

The proposal would be implemented if it is passed. It happens when:

* **Quorum**. _Validators_ holding 40% or more delegated LikeCoin particated in the voting.
* **Simple majority**. With the exception of Abstain, more than 50% of the votes \(voting power is proportional to delegated _LikeCoin_\) go to Yes.
* **No veto**. Less than one-third of the votes go to Veto.

In case quorum is not reached or the proposal is vetoed, the 1 mil _LikeCoin_ deposit goes to the **Community Pool**. In other cases, the deposit will be returned to the _Likers._

## Future Development <a id="b575"></a>

With the Genesis of _Liker Land_, _LikeCoin_ ecosystem __is entering a whole new paradigm. Services and governance of _Liker Land_ is designed in a way closely resembling a modern society, with some enhancements. With the governance by liquid democracy in place, every aspect of _Liker Land_ can be improved through proposals of change, including, most fundamentally, the constitution.

As a result, the design and governance of the Republic will no longer be solely in the hands of core development team, who will nonetheless continue to dedicate their time and effort to _LikeCoin._ From now on, _Liker Land_ will be collectively owned and governed by her stakeholders, all _Likers_.

Despite all the exciting development, it is just the Genesis.
