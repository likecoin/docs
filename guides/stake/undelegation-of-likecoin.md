### **Attention regarding Undelegation**

Once you've confirmed your undelegation, the following happens:

1. It takes 21 days cooling-off period to undelegate and get back the LikeCoin to your own wallet, the LikeCoin cannot be redelegated, rewarded or transferred as well.
2. Validator lost his/her voting power of the amount the LikeCoin withdrew.
