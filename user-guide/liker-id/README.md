# Liker ID

A citizen in LikeCoin DAO is known as a Liker. Each Liker has a unique Liker ID for identification. Likers can be writers, photographers, illustrators, editors, curators, or readers.

Users can register a Liker ID using either of these two mechanisms:

* [Keplr](register-with-keplr.md) - Register a Liker ID via the Keplr Chrome/Brave browser extension. Users can use [dao.like.co](https://dao.like.co/) to manage and delegate LikeCoin.
* [General method ( Authcore )](register/) - Although users can register a Liker ID on the [Liker Land app](https://liker.land/getapp) or [web](https://liker.land/) to [manage](../../general-guides/wallet/like-pay.md), [delegate](../../general-guides/stake/delegation-of-likecoin.md) LikeCoin, and check out [rewards](../creatortools/rewards.md), this login method will gradually be phased out. Users are advised to [export your seed words](export-seed-words.md) from Authcore and import them into [Keplr](../../general-guides/wallet/keplr/) into Keplr in order to manage their LikeCoin effectively.
