# LikeCoin button

LikeCoin button is the core medium to interact with your readers for Like, Share and Archive.

From the LikeCoin button on each creation, readers can:

* [Turn "Likes" into Rewards](../liker-land/like.md): Convert every Like into actual, quantifiable income.
* Feature content: [Super Like](../liker-land/superlike.md) content and recommend it to the community on [depub.space](../depub.space/)
* [Collect Writing NFTs](../../general-guides/writing-nft/collect-writing-nft/): which is content stored on the blockchain with traceability and immutability.

## Use Case

### LikeCoin button

[Matters](https://matters.news/) s empowered with the LikeCoin button by default. Content creators can provide their [Liker ID](../liker-id/) to [InMedia](https://www.inmediahk.net/) for embedding the LikeCoin button. We-Media can install the [LikeCoin WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/likecoin/), which automatically adds a LikeCoin button to the end of each article. [Medium](https://medium.com/) writers can insert the LikeCoin button link to embed it into an article. The LikeCoin button also supports [Blogspot ( Blogger.com )](https://www.blogger.com/dashboard/reading), [Pixnet](https://appmarket.pixnet.tw/#!/addon/1331) and other content platforms.

### NFT Widget

If the article has been published as a Writing NFT, the LikeCoin button will evolve into an [NFT Widget](../../general-guides/writing-nft/collect-writing-nft/nft-widget.md) with clap and [collect Writing NFT](../../general-guides/writing-nft/collect-writing-nft/) functions.
