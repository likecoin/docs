# Cannot get reward?

Civic Liker's budget will always be delivered accordingly to claps.  There is no circumstances that the system will hold the fund from releasing.

For the Creators fund, however, there are several conditions that the system won't release to one's wallet:

* Your own claps. They won't get any reward.&#x20;
* Blacklisted.  Don't attempt to open multiple IDs and clap among the group, the system may identify as an abuse and blacklist your IDs.
