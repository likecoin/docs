# Creators Fund

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/group\_56\_copy\_4 (1).png>)

Creator's reward consists of two parts: Civic Liker Stake Reward and Creators Fund.

The Creators funding source is from the LikeCoin community pool. The monthly budget is roughly matched with the stake reward generated by all Civic Likers in the previous month. The more to stake, more budget can be spent for rewarding creativity. Creation Funds are distributed daily at approximately 12:00 GMT+8.

Free Likers can also help to distribute a small amount of funds to the creators.

The usage of the fund will be reviewed regularly by the Creators Fund Committee established under proposal #23 of LikeCoin DAO.
