# Like - Reinventing the Like

Any website embedded with a LikeCoin button can convert "Likes" into rewards, allowing each clap to support content creators and transform likes into actual income.

Users who have registered a [Liker ID](../liker-id/) can use the [Liker Land app to browse articles](./) and easily clap or "Like" to support the creators. When a LikeCoin button is present in an article, Likers can clap it 1-5 times to indicate their level of appreciation. Each clap represents a vote for the content, contributing to the creator's share of the daily [Creators Fund](../civic-liker/creators-fund.md) allocation.

[Civic Likers](../civic-liker/), in particular, have a significant impact on the distribution of the daily [Creators Fund](../civic-liker/creators-fund.md) through their claps. By being a Civic Liker, users can use the special feature called "[Super Like](superlike.md)". Clicking the LikeCoin button for the 6th time allows them to share their favorite and noteworthy content to [depub.space](../depub.space/).

Moreover, creators can track their [weekly and daily rewards](../creatortools/rewards.md) received from each article. They will also receive [monthly reports](../creatortools/monthly-report.md) from the Liker Land team, providing insights into their achievements.

Readers also have the option to send LikeCoin directly to the creators using [LIKE pay](../../general-guides/wallet/like-pay.md).
