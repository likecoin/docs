# Glossary

## Basic concepts <a href="#448e" id="448e"></a>

### LikeCoin DAO <a href="#84f4" id="84f4"></a>

_LikeCoin DAO_ is a decentralized community in cyberspace among content creators and consumers, who collectively own and govern the community.

In blockchain terminology, _LikeCoin DAO_ is a decentralized autonomous organization.

### Liker <a href="#5799" id="5799"></a>

A citizen in _LikeCoin DAO_. Each _Liker_ has a unique _Liker ID_ to identify herself. While many _Likers_ are writers, photographers, illustrators, editors and curators, _LikeCoin DAO_ totally welcomes silent content consumers and offers services for them to involve and contribute without creating contents.

### Civic Liker <a href="#75ea" id="75ea"></a>

A _Liker_ who delegates at least 5,000 LIKE to the Civic Liker validator node, and distribute the corresponding staking reward via the LikeCoin button. _Civic Liker_ is essentially _the_ tax payer in _LikeCoin DAO,_ enjoying various benefits while at the same time supporting creators.&#x20;

### Liker Land app <a href="#2696" id="2696"></a>

Reader, passport and wallet all integrated in one single app. [_Liker Land_ app](https://like.co/in/getapp) is essentially government of the DAO on your palm.

Some tech lovers prefer lower level tools such as command line interface and hardware wallet. It requires significant technical know-how and is beyond the scope of this article.

### LikeCoin button <a href="#82e1" id="82e1"></a>

The trademarked hands-clapping button attached to stories, images, illustrations and other creative contents, on which a _Liker_ claps to show her appreciation.

### LikeCoin token <a href="#c246" id="c246"></a>

Usually called _LikeCoin_ for short, it is the de facto token in _LikeCoin DAO._ _LikeCoin_ has 3 major uses:

* **Storing and exchanging value**. Used to reward creators, _validators_, and for payments in general.
* **Representing the contribution and thus voting power of a **_**Liker**_. The more contribution a _Liker_ makes, the more _LikeCoin_ she receives and the more influential power she has in _LikeCoin DAO_.
* **Bridging with other communities and the traditional world**. _LikeCoin_ can be exchanged into and from Bitcoin, Ethereum, TWD, HKD and other traditional and crypto currencies. The ticker of _LikeCoin_ is LIKE. Note however that a token trading with the ticker LIKE is not necessarily _LikeCoin_. Special attention has to be paid to avoid scamming.

### LikeCoin chain <a href="#aa59" id="aa59"></a>

A distributed ledger of the open government of _LikeCoin DAO_. A sovereign, application specific blockchain designed for content creation and information property management, offering high-speed, low cost and most importantly, independence. Data on _LikeCoin chain_ is open and can be visualized on [**Big Dipper**](https://likecoin.bigdipper.live/) and **Mintscan**.

The very first beta of _LikeCoin chain_, code-named **KaiTak**, was released on Apr 2019 and was upgraded to **Taipei** on Sept 2019 as the new beta testnet. First public release of _LikeCoin chain_, **SheungWan**, was just launched on Nov 15, signaling the establishment of _LikeCoin DAO_.

_LikeCoin chain_ **FoTan**, which incorporates advanced features such as International Standard Content Number (_“ISCN”_), is planned in 2020.

### Validator <a href="#9d28" id="9d28"></a>

Operates a set of servers 24x7 to validate all transactions of _Likers_, including token transfers, content publishing, voting and etc. A _validator_ on _LikeCoin chain_ is both a bank and a senator in _LikeCoin DAO_.

To start with, _validators_ of _LikeCoin chain_ include [**National Taipei University of Technology**](https://www.ntut.edu.tw/), [**Taiwan FactCheck Center**](https://tfc-taiwan.org.tw/),[**Forbole**](https://www.forbole.com/), **The** [**Standnews**](https://thestandnews.com/), [**Culture and Media Education Foundation**](https://www.cmef.org.hk/eng), [**Hong Kong Creative Open Technology Association**](https://cota.hk/), [**Matters Lab**](https://matters.news/), [**GLOs**](https://www.glos.world/), [**Enyk Security**](https://enyk.io/), [**UDomain**](https://www.udomain.com/) and [**OurSky**](https://oursky.com/).

## Mechanism <a href="#d993" id="d993"></a>

### Token issuance <a href="#397c" id="397c"></a>

When _LikeCoin_ was first introduced in 2017, it was an “ERC-20 token” issued on Ethereum blockchain. To distinguish from the new standard used in _LikeCoin DAO_, the legacy token will be stated explicitly as LikeCoin ERC-20 while the new token referred as _LikeCoin token_ or simply _LikeCoin_.

Following the original _LikeCoin_ whitepaper, there will be up to 2bil _LikeCoin_ in the long run. The _LikeCoin_ is assigned to **Token Sale Pool** (360,538,485), **Ecosystem Development Pool** (439,461,515), **Team Pool** (200mil), and **Creators Pool** (1bil) for their corresponding usages. 1bil _LikeCoin_ was minted in Genesis for migration from **Token Sale Pool**, **Ecosystem Development Pool**, **Team Pool**, while **Creators Pool** will be processed in future upgrade.

### **Migration** <a href="#4ee6" id="4ee6"></a>

As _LikeCoin DAO_ starts to operate, tentatively set on Dec 2 2019, _LikeCoin_ will replace LikeCoin ERC-20 as the official token in _LikeCoin DAO_, which means content creators will be rewarded in _LikeCoin_. The 1bil _LikeCoin_ at Genesis was stored in a migration pool and the only way to unlock a certain amount of _LikeCoin_ is to migrate the same amount of LikeCoin ERC-20, on a 1:1 basis. A migration page will be provided for _Likers_. LikeCoin ERC-20, however, can still be kept and traded on [Liquid](https://www.liquid.com/) for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

When LikeCoin ERC-20 is migrated to _LikeCoin_, the former will be burnt on Ethereum, so that the total number of _LikeCoin plus_ LikeCoin ERC-20 in circulation remains unchanged.

New _LikeCoin_ will be minted at an inflation rate determined by the validators collectively. The inflation rate was set at 1% at the Genesis of _LikeCoin DAO_. The newly minted _LikeCoin_ is for rewarding validation of transactions (see **Validating Transaction** below).

### Rewarding creativity. Supporting the commons. <a href="#61ef" id="61ef"></a>

With _LikeCoin DAO_ being a community of content creators and lovers, appreciation of and rewarding for creativity is a core value.

In contrast to Like Button of Facebook and other social media, tapping a _LikeCoin button — clapping —_ provides the corresponding creators with tangible rewards. A content can be clapped by a _Liker_ 1–5 times to reflect the degree of appreciation. Each clap represents a vote for the content, helping the creator receive part of the **Creators Pool** allocated for that day.

A _Civic Liker_ enjoys higher weighting for her claps, which other than the **Creators Pool** also distributes all of her own monthly payment to creators on average. _LikeCoin button_ is like an assistant to _Likers,_ helping them micro reward creativity automatically with claps as a signal of appreciation.

### Validating Transaction <a href="#9e68" id="9e68"></a>

In order to reach consensus in a community, some trusted parties have to record all transactions. In traditional world, this is performed by banks which charges various fees. In _LikeCoin DAO_, peer-to-peer transactions in general takes 5 seconds at extremely low cost. Such a system is realized collectively by _validators_, endorsed by _Likers_.

Endorsement by _Likers_ is reflected by _delegation._ When a _Liker_ delegates her _LikeCoin_ to a _validator_, she is trusting its technical ability, knowledge and integrity, and is letting it represent her. Similar to saving in banks, delegated _LikeCoin_ is still owned by the _Liker_, but it takes 21 days to undelegate and get back the _LikeCoin_ to one’s own wallet.

The voting power of a particular _validator_ equals the total amount of _LikeCoin_ delegated to it, since it reflects the level of endorsement it receives from the community. Approximately every 5 seconds, a block is created in _LikeCoin chain_ to record all transactions during the period. Every _validator_ has to agree and sign the block to confirm. If everyone or more than two third of voting power agrees, the block and thus all transactions within it will be confirmed. In this case, all signing _validators_ will be rewarded some newly minted _LikeCoin_ according to their voting power. The newly minted _LikeCoin_ comes from inflation, which is set at 1% at genesis. The rewards are split 50:50 between the _validator_ and the _Likers_ who delegated their _LikeCoin_.

If, however, a _validator_ does not perform its duty or act maliciously, there will be penalty:

* **Unavailability**. Offline for more than 95% of times in the previous 10,000 blocks, i.e. the _validator_ participated for fewer than 500 blocks in the previously 10,000 blocks. In this case 0.01% of the delegated _LikeCoin_ will be slashed and the _validator_ be “jailed”, until the _validator_ unjail itself after at least 10 minutes.
* **Double signing**. Validates 2 conflicting blocks at the same time, which is fatal because it allows an amount to be spent twice. In this case, the _validator_ will be permanently removed, and 5% of the delegations will be slashed.

In both cases, delegated _LikeCoin_ from _Likers_ will be slashed at the same ratio. It is important for _Likers_ to delegate only to _validators_ they can trust.

In blockchain jargon, the above mechanism of decentralized consensus is called Byzantine Fault Tolerance (**BFT**), achieved through Delegated Proof of Stake (**DPoS**).

## **Governance** <a href="#ca09" id="ca09"></a>

As stated in the very beginning, _LikeCoin DAO_ is collectively owned and governed by the community. A [liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid\_democracy) system is designed and deployed upon Genesis to enable the self governance of _LikeCoin DAO_ by all _Likers_ through _validators_.

### Delegation <a href="#c538" id="c538"></a>

When a _Liker_ delegates _LikeCoin_ to a _validator_, not only does the _Liker_ help validating transactions for the network and earns rewards, but the _Liker_ also endorses the _validator_ to raise proposals and vote on behalf of them. A _Liker_ as stakeholder may also decide the amount of _LikeCoin_ to delegate to reflect the level of endorsement, and may delegate to one or more _validators_. Delegation is like voting in a society under representative democracy but in a more flexible way.

After the LikeCoin chain upgraded to FoTan on August 18, 2021, stakeholders can [direct vote](../general-guides/governance/direct-vote/) for a proposal.

### Raising a proposal <a href="#81f6" id="81f6"></a>

Every proposal is a change to the current system. After all, it is not very meaningful to pass a proposal that changes nothing. All _validators_ may raise proposals.

Some aspects of proposals include:

* **Parameter Change proposal**: to change one or more parameters. If accepted, the requested parameter change is updated automatically by the proposal handler upon conclusion of the voting period.
* **Community Pool Spend proposal**: to decide the usage of the community pool
* **Text proposal**: All the proposals that are not covered by the above two types go under this type, e.g.: about governance principle. Examples in the past: 4th proposal about direct democracy implementation, and the 9th proposal about delegation of ecosystem development fund.

By the way, two more proposal types are supported after the FoTan chain upgrade: **Software Upgrade Proposal** and **Cancel Software Upgrade Proposal**. See the [Cosmos SDK documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/gov/01\_concepts.html) for details.

Any validator can raise a proposal. In order to have a proposal to enter the voting period, 100k _LikeCoin_ has to be deposited within 2 weeks. The deposit may come from other _validators_ and _Likers._

In case the proposal fails to get 100k _LikeCoin_ deposit in 2-week time, the proposal will be abandoned and the deposit will be forfeit and go to the **Community Pool.** The usage of the pool is determined by further proposals.

### Voting <a href="#a839" id="a839"></a>

Once a proposal reaches 100K LikeCoin, it immediately enters Voting period. All _validators_ and stakeholders may then vote during the one week Voting period. There are four options to every proposal: **Yes**, **No**, **Abstain** and **Veto**. Veto is to express a “No” so strong that the _validator_ believes the proposal should not be proposed in the first place, and should have its deposit expropriated to **Community Pool**.

During the voting period, if a stakeholder does not agree with the option picked by the _validator_ representing them, they may transfer their delegated _LikeCoin_ to another _validator_ or direct vote to overrule. This is another point that liquid democracy outperforms traditional representative democracy.

### Result <a href="#a4c5" id="a4c5"></a>

The proposal would be implemented if it is passed. It happens when:

* Quorum: The voting power (delegated LikeCoin) that participated in the Voting period has passed the minimum percentage 40%
* Simple majority: Not counting the abstention votes, there are more votes (>50%) in favour than against.
* No veto: Less than 30% voting power has voted a veto.

If the proposal fails to achieve quorum, or gets more than 1/3 voting power as veto, then the proposal will be turned down and the deposited LikeCoin will be expropriated to the **Community Pool;** else the deposit will be transferred back to the owners.
