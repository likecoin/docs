Take a look at the order book on the right hand side. The figures in red are those orders who want to "Sell", for example below there are people who want to sell 362 LikeCoin at the price of 0.15720 USDT/LIKE, and then some other people want to sell 3300 LikeCoin at 0.016800 USDT/LIKE. If you want to buy 3600 LikeCoin, you can buy them all at 0.016800 USDT/LIKE

If you want to sell your LikeCoin, you have to monitor the seller in green. For example below if you want to sell 7000 LikeCoin, it is guaranteed to be sold at 0.015700 USDT/LIKE because the highest selling price is 0.015700 to buy 7719 LikeCoin

To make it simple, if you want to sell, check out the orders in green; if you want to buy, check out the orders in red. You can also take a look at the "Latest" transaction statistic on the right hand side.
